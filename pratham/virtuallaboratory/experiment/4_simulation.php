In the particular experiment, we have to input the frequency and the orbit
altitude of the satellite. For a certain altitude, the satellite will have a particular speed which has a finite speed relative to the ground-station at earthâ€™s surface. For this expt., we have assumed that satellite pass is an overhead pass i.e., elevation goes from 0
to 90 degrees. Also the location of the ground-station is on the equator and satellite orbits just overhead the equator. The output from the experiment is the change in frequency and the final observed frequency itself.</p>
