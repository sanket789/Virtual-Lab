Virtual Laboratory in Satellite Modelling & Simulation offers distance learning opportunity in Satellite Technology through online experiments. In this laboratory, students can perform experiments with the same tools that helped ISSP team to learn about Satellites; these are the same tools that helped ISSP team to design Pratham. </div></td>

Each experiment is preceded by a brief tutorial that will help you brush up necessary background material.  It will suggest extra reading material if you find the tutorials difficult.  Once you complete the tutorials you can move on to set up the experiment and perform it.  Setting up of the experiment is actually preparation of input data for the simulation. Performing the experiment is the remote execution of the simulation.  Results will be presented to you graphically in most cases.  You will also have the option to download the data for your own processing.</div></td>
