Out of this, only αQ gets absorbed by the body. The rest of it is either transmitted through the body or reflected by the body. The value of α is a surface property. Materials having the same thermal properties like conductivity, specific heat and density can have different α since α is only dependent of the surface finish. So the amount of energy absorbed by the plate in time Δt is given by

  		  <td class="Textz">This system generally would not represent any real physical system. If it did then the plate would eventually melt since the temperature of the plate constantly goes on increasing. In reality all bodies at finite temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. This is known as the Stefan Boltzmann relationship. Because of this what happens is that the system would stabilize to a temperature where the energy lost due to emission to free space would become the same as the incident radiant flux.  This temperature is called the steady state temperature of the system. The next few problems shall explain this in a better manner.</td>
