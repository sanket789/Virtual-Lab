  		  <td class="Textz">The definition of steady state temperature is the temperature which does not change with time. In a way, it is saying that the system is in equilibrium. Now let us revisit the governing equation. When the temperature has reached steady state implies that the time derivative of the temperature is zero. This implies that &alpha;*1000*A &ndash; &epsilon; *&sigma;*A*T<sup>4</sup> = 0. On solving this equation we get the desired result. </td>

  		  <td class="Textz">From the above relation the dependencies of the steady state temperature on various material properties and surface properties are clear. So as the ratio of &alpha; /&epsilon; increases the steady state temperature increases</td>

  		  <td class="Textz">Note this is not the temperature of the body always. The body starts at some initial temperature which can be totally independent of the steady state temperature. The variation of temperature from its initial value to its steady state value is the transient. The further the initial temperature from the steady state temperature, larger the time taken to reach steady state.</td>
