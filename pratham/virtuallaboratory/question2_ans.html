          A plate of area 1 m<sup>2</sup> whose normal makes an angle &theta; with incident radiation actually presents an effective area of &lsquo;Cos &theta;&rsquo; to the radiation.

Hence the flux on a plate of unit area at the surface of the earth will be 1000 Cos &theta; W/m<sup>2</sup>, where &theta; is the angle that normal to the side of the plate we are interested in makes with respect to the line joining the plate to sun. When -90 < &theta; < 90 the plate will recieve some (>0) radiation on the side we are interested in.  When -90 > &theta; > -180 OR 90 < &theta; < 180 radiation is actually falling on the side opposite to the one we are interested in</td>

  		  <td class="Textz">Let us understand the role that some of the parameters play in deciding how much radiation falls on a plate 1 m<sup>2</sup> in area at the surface of the Earth. <br /><br />
Consider the plate whose normal is along the suns radiation. Consider an axis system where x-axis and y-axis are on the surface of the plate and z-axis is along the normal to the plate.  If the plate is now rotated through an angle about y-axis OR x-axis, the amount of radiation falling on it will be affected by Cosine of the amount of rotation.  But a rotation about z-axis will not affect the radiation falling on it. We can also visualize the plate as not rotating, but the sun moving in such a way that solar radiation makes an angle with respect to the z-axis of the plate.  Consider following cases.</td>
