  		  <td class="Textz">The answer is very intuitive. The temperature cannot always go on increasing because the flux is negative for some time which implies the time derivative of the temperature is negative and hence the temperature should definitely decrease in that time. A steady state also cannot be achieved because the incident flux is a function of time. Since we have applied a cyclic thermal load, one can anticipate the temperature also to vary cyclically though not necessarily with the same frequency or amplitude.</td>

  		  <td class="Textz">Till now we have always assumed that the plate has only one temperature or in other words, there are no spatial gradients of temperature. This is also equivalent to saying that the conductivity of the material is infinite. This assumption is also called the lumped mass assumption. So what happens when the conductivity of the material is finite. As the conductivity goes on decreasing the spatial gradients will go on increasing but the average temperature of the system will not change considerably because of this change introduced. </td>
